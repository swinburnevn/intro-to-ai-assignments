# Progress Week 5

## Programming

* new 'informed agent' superclass added for ease of use

* added CLI interface and changed structure of views slightly

* added directional cost to the cost functions as per research initiative

* greedy + astar fixed with some issues re: the implementation of priority queue, local pruning removed.

* updated the delay code, it's much more responsible now and a part of the CLI arguments

  



I do want to implement screenshots and possibly create batch scripts for running extensive tests

SFML Screenshots -> https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Tutorial:-How-to-take-a-screenshot%3F





* Added SFML screenshot support
* added CLI testing support for mass-testing
* wrote batch file for testing along with making more useful outputs
* did testing and saved all information to separate folder for later processing, though most of the useful information is provided in the CLI interface
* updated CLI testing script to be more descriptive (outputs all moved to a log file) and corrected issue with triggering directional costs via arguments. It's fixed and is now output-able. 
* lots of report writing and re-writing using the first title title for nko11.2.
* Testing is complete with all data gathered from tests put into excel sheet (space complexity for now, time complexity still required)
* Even morer repoierrer writing. 



## Research

* IDA*? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LMXQ1NGHwU 37:11
* Big O notation and a few other basics to write report on
