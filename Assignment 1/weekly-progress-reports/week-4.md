# Progress Week 4

## Programming

* GBFS and AStar done
* Added IDDFS, as the uninformed additional search algorithm. I don't like it and given the structure of the program, it would be deviating too much from how its described so let's leave it in for now
* Added UCS after a lot of fighting. I am battle-worn but it's finished. It has a cost function despite being uninformed, and therefore some critical restructuring was needed
* Included a lost state for bad searches or bad maps. created an awful map.
* updated node views to include more detail such as internal lists and hashed colours
* added scrolling to node view for ease of use for incredibly deep trees
* Minor graphical tweaks all around to improve usability

## Research

* Slowly starting report writing
