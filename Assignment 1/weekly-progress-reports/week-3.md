# Progress Week 3

## Programming

* BFS and DFS added
* Both required MASSIVE restructuring and rethinking of the general layout of agents and their thinking methods. This comes from the game-esque design where the program does not perform the search in one call, but must visualise it via repeated calls. This also means a lot of code was added and needs to be refactored.
* Added a NODE\<T\> Class to aid in structuring the program instead of using positions, added new branch for this since it would require even more restructuring and refactoring. 
* The code is quite complex now, I can't imagine trying to explain this easily.
* Finished refactoring and restructuring for the node classes, and updated view windows to reflect this
* Added in node tree. This was an entire Saturday's of work to try and get the parents/children of the node to display in the right position



## Research

* GBFS and ASTAR were the main topics of research and understanding this week.
* The goal was to understand and therefore implement them
* Uniform Cost Search and Iterative-Deepening Depth-First-Search also took quite a lot of time.
