## Preface

(This will be removed)

Markdown has better support for nicer code, whereas word has better support for images. Too bad I can't use both...

## I. Instructions for Use

The following arguments can be passed to the navigation program:

```
robot-navigation.exe [filename] [method] <gui/ss> <delay> <true>
```

* `[filename]` 

  * Required, indicates map.
